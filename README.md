This GitHub repository contains the codebase for a final project in Artificial Intelligence class. My project is about detecting black holes in videos of stars in space by using AI models and ML algorithms.
Platfrom developed using Python and was implemented in a website using HTML code. 

The project is devided to three main parts. The first one is YOLOv8 which is an object detection algorithm that is based on CNN. This algorithm detect multiple stars in each frame of the video.
The second part is the data analytics that covert the raw data from the YOLOv8 model into usable insights on the star's motion. The third part is an ANN model that determines if a star is orbiting a black hole using key factors of the star's motion.


The project included half a year of research development.
